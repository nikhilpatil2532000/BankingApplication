This was my internship project where i created web API's to handle basic CRUD operations of Banking application. 

You can create multiple bank accounts of multiple types, like saving or current. 

You can perform search, update, delete, and perform different transactions like credit or debit based on type of account. 

In this project, I use AutoMapper library, Dependancy injection, Multiple-Dependancy injection, also use swagger and postman for api testing. 

I use SQL server and database-first approach to create data-access-layer(DAL).
